## Installation
You can find GA Connect on [heroku.com/ga-connect](http://www.gooogle.com).
If you"d like to install it locally, (explain how to install dependencies here.)

## Our Approach
We first identified that a personal pain that we felt as GA students that we wanted to solve was the limited opportunities we had to collaborate and get to know other GA students, particular UX design students.

We then discussed potential technological solutions, and came up with the idea of a GA-exclusive social platform focused on matching students across courses who share common goals. After brainstorming several personas and speaking to potential stakeholders and users, we wrote several user stories inspired by our learnings to fully flesh out the functions that users require in this website.


## Personas & user stories
We created 3 personas to flesh out the specific needs for each type of user GA Connect is intended to serve.

- **Mark the networker:** Mark is a Product Management student who just sarted building his startup. He"d like to network with other entrepreneurial GA students so they can share their journey together and provide each other helpful advice. 
- **Bill the job hunter:** Bill is a Web Development Immersive student who has almost completed the course who wants to get a job as a junior web developer in the startup Orange Bubble. He"d like to continue meeting up with other WDI students after the course to work together on building their portfolios, on their CVs, practice interviews and keep each other accountable for attending networking events.
- **Adam the startup builder:** Adam is a Web Development Immersive student looking for one UX Design Immersive student and one Product Management student to build a startup together.
- **Emily the administrator:** Emily is a GA administrator responsible for the management of students and classes. She wants to encourage GA students across courses to get to know each other better.
